# E-Commerce Microservices Architecture

## Overview

This repository contains the microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform. The architecture is designed using .NET Core and Ocelot API Gateway, providing a flexible and scalable solution for handling customer orders, product management, and customer information.

## Microservices

The project consists of the following microservices:

- **Customer.Microservice**: Manages customer data and operations.
- **Order.Microservice**: Handles order processing and management.
- **Product.Microservice**: Manages product listings and details.
- **Gateway.WebApi**: Acts as an API gateway for routing requests to the appropriate microservices.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete functionality for customers, orders, and products.
- **Ocelot API Gateway**: Simplifies request routing and load balancing across microservices.
- **Docker Support**: Containerized microservices for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Integrated Swagger UI for API documentation and testing.
